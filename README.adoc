= Orchestrator Workers Example

This is a Spring AI and Spring Integration application that demonstrates the Orchestrator-Workers pattern. It analyzes a task and breaks it down into multiple approaches (formal, conversational, etc.), then generates different versions of content based on those approaches.

This is a Spring Integration implementation of the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/agentic-patterns/orchestrator-workers[Orchestrator Workers example] provided by Spring AI. It is implemented using a Splitter and Aggregator pattern.

== How It Works

1. The application receives a task (e.g., "Write a product description for a new eco-friendly water bottle")
2. The orchestrator analyzes the task and breaks it down into different approaches (formal, conversational, etc.)
3. Workers process each approach to generate different versions of content
4. The results are aggregated and returned

== Requirements

* Java 17 or Above
* OpenAI API Key

== Build

[source,shell]
----
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API key>
mvn clean package
----

== Run

[source,shell]
----
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API key>
java -jar target/orchestrator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

== Example

The application comes with a default example that generates a product description for an eco-friendly water bottle in different styles. The output will be displayed in the console when you run the application.

To modify the example or create your own tasks, edit the `OrchestratorApplication.java` file and change the message payload in the `applicationRunner` method.
